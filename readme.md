C++ Observations
================

This repo is a gathering of all my observations while trying to learn
C++.

About Me
--------

I come from a background of Web Development and heavy use in PHP. My
coding style is very object-oriented.

I have no specifically defined style of writing code, so certain things
about my writing style may change.

-   ### Pointers

    Of and relating to all things pointers!

    1.  #### variablesGoneMissing.cpp

        In this code, I’m trying to prove to myself the importance of
        passing constant references. I tried to demonstrate how a
        pointer can be lost forever.

    2.  #### leakingMemoryFromAnotherVariable.cpp

        In this code, I’m showing how you can overwrite the value of a
        variable while leaking into the memory of another unknown memory
        address.
