		<h1>C++ Observations</h1>
		<p>
			This repo is a gathering of all my observations while trying to learn C++.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I come from a background of Web Development and heavy use in PHP. My coding style
is very object-oriented.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have no specifically defined style of writing code, so certain things about my
writing style may change.
